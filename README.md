# PDFChat 📄💬

PDFChat is a project that allows users to upload PDF files, ask questions related to the content of the PDF files, and receive answers generated by the LangChain model. The project leverages various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and models to enable question-answering functionality for PDF documents.

## Features 🚀

- **PDF Upload**: 📁 Users can upload PDF files containing textual content.
- **Chunk Splitting**: 🔖 PDF documents are split into smaller chunks for efficient processing.
- **Vector Database Storage**: 🗄️ FAISS vector database is used for storing and retrieving document vectors.
- **Question-Answering**: ❓ Users can ask questions related to the content of the uploaded PDF files.
- **Answer Generation**: 🧠 Answers to user questions are generated using Google's Flan-T5-XXL model via LangChain pipeline.
